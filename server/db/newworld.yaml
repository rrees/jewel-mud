    You are on a small bewildered path winding its way between the hills in
    lack of better things to do. To the south you have a splendid view over the
    flat, vast, desolate plains. To the north the hills grow steadily darker and
    foreboding. This is the cause of no sunset, it is rather the power of evil
    penetrating these quiet hills. Glancing around you notice only a single bird.

    You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
    small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
    towering over you, overwhelming you...
    The small path seems to have second thoughts about these hills because it
    starts winding unnecessarily, turning several times around itself.
    To the south the hills have a lighter hue of dark. To the north however, the
    hills have become nightblack holes in the distant mountains.

    to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
    feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
    carved into the mountain.
    You feel you can hear the cry of help from a thousand silent voices all coming
    from an even darker hole in the mountain to the north marking the entrance to
    a cave (or a grave :-).

    your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
    over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
    some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
    A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
    good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
    others haven't breathed before you.
    To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.

    You are in the red room, one of the guest rooms in Dragons's mansion. The
    walls are wallpapered a deep warm red, and dark mahogany panelling nicely com-
    plements them. There is a large, warm waterbed and a sofa group in dark wood
    with leather upholstery, including a coffee table. Heavy brown curtains are
    pulled away from the wide windows, to reveal a nice view towards the grove.

    You are standing in the middle of Dragon's kitchen. Contrary to popular
    belief, He *Doesn't* eat virgins, which is amply demonstrated by the large
    variety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of
    tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
    along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
    stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
    than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

    You are standing in the middle of a vast palisander floor. This is where
    Dragon entertains large number of guests, but the cloth-covered chairs
    standing forlornly in a corner suggests that this does not happen often.
    There are doors in the south and west walls, while to the east there is a
    short corridor to the greenhouse.

    This is Dragons' greenhouse. Green light filters in slantwise through the
    plants, giving the room a subtropical ambience. It is not really hot in here,
    though, rather a pleasantly warm temperature. The walls are all windows, except 
    the eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to 
    see out for all the greenery here. There is a set of easy-chairs and a glass
    coffee table. To the south, there is a wide double door out to a sunlit 
    terrace.

    This is Dragons' dining hall. There is a large long solid oak table,
    seating at least 24, with heavy, wooden chairs to match. The oak panel walls
    are filled with paintings. There are doors to the north and east, and to the
    west there is a wide double door opening out onto the sunlit terrace.

    You are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion. To the
    west, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake. To the north
    is the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and wonderful
    colors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the east. It is
    warm and calm here. There is a white-painted table with a parasol here,
    together with a matched set of chairs.
