  title: The Southern end of the hall
  description: |
    You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
    light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
    the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
    on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
    To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
    shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
    north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
    looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
    this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

  description: |
    This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
    shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
    dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
    looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
    a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
    hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
    east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
    west wall.

    A large staircase leads down to the hall. A couple of doors open up to a
    broad balcony to the south.

    to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
    originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
    It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
               ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "

    Surrounding to all sides but north, a pile of great slabs of glass has

    north, there is at least four yards between the furthest reaches of the

    This is the Daemon's Lair. It is suffused in a purple glow from 
    the myriad multishaped and -sized screens covering most of three 
    walls. There is a rung ladder on the only uncluttered wall, going 
    up through a shaft in the ceiling. There is an easy chair, a 
    rumpled bed and a table piled high with yestercycle's dirty dishes. 
    In the wall to the west, a tunnel leads out to the Matrix Fault.

    tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
    along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
    stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
